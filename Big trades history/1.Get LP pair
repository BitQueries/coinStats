You already have that information fetched via the initial token's price query, just store it in array for later use like in this case.


Query to get Liquidity pair only (not recommended).


{  
  ethereum(network:DESIRED NETWORK HERE) {
    dexTrades(
      baseCurrency: {is:"INSERT DESIRED CURRENCY ADDRESS HERE"}
      options: {desc: "trades"}
    ) {
      poolToken: smartContract {
        address {
          address
        }
      }
      trades: count
    }
  }
}
