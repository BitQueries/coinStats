Get daily volume for coin.


This is simple query retrieving the volume of token for desired time period.
Mind that bitquery's service may have delayed and innacurate data for some of the tokens (especially shitcoins with low volumes).

"bnbVolume:" and "usdVolome:" are aliases that represent the volume for the selected time period in BNB and USD respectively.
Aliases can be changed with any desirable name for easier readability.


{
  ethereum(network: bsc) {
    dexTrades(
      date: {since:"PREVIOUS DAY" till:"NOW DAY"}
      baseCurrency: { is: "DESIRED CURRENCY"}
    ) {
     baseCurrency {
      name
      symbol
      address
    }
      bnbVolume: tradeAmount(in:BNB)
      usdVolome: tradeAmount(in: USD)
    }
  }
}
