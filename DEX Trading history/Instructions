Trades chart history.



1.Get lp address for desired coin.
2.Get token's current price (you already have that from the chart data stored in array) and compare it with the amounts to take usd/bnb spent/bought.
3.Get all senders to LP (these are sells)
4.Get all receivers from LP (these are buys)
5.Compare the fetched information of holder's trades and compare it agains the current token's price to calculate how much they bought/sold in USD/BNB or whatever currency the token is paired with.


Steps 1 and 2 can be combined into 1 query.


1.You can get Liquidity pair address with the current price/OHLC query on page's loading and store it in array or get only Liquidity pair address info.

Query:

{
  ethereum(network: bsc) {
    dexTrades(
      options: {limit: 5, desc: "timeInterval.minute"}
      time: {since: "INSERT DESIRED TIME HERE", till: "INSERT DESIRED TIME HERE"}
      exchangeName: {is: "Pancake v2"}
      baseCurrency: {is: "INSERT DESIRED CURRENCY ADDRESS HERE"}
      quoteCurrency: {in: ["0xbb4CdB9CBd36B01bD1cBaEBF2De08d9173bc095c","0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955",
        "0xe9e7cea3dedca5984780bafc599bd69add087d56", "0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82", "0x8ac76a51cc950d9822d68b83fe1ad97b32cd580d"]}
    ) {
      timeInterval {
        minute(count:1)
      }
      poolToken: smartContract {
        address {
          address
        }
      }
      baseCurrency {
        symbol
        address
      }
      baseAmountTraded: baseAmount
      quoteCurrency {
        symbol
        address
      }
      quoteAmountTraded: quoteAmount
      totalTrades: count
      priceInQuotedCurrency: quotePrice
      max_price: quotePrice(calculate: maximum)
      min_price: quotePrice(calculate: minimum)
      median_price: quotePrice(calculate: median)
      open_price: minimum(of: block, get: quote_price)
      close_price: maximum(of: block, get: quote_price)
    }
  }
}



Or get only LP info (not recommended, because more API points are used with 2 queries)


LP info Query:


{  
  ethereum(network:bsc) {
    dexTrades(
      baseCurrency: {is:"INSERT DESIRED CURRENCY ADDRESS HERE"}
      options: {desc: "trades"}
    ) {
      poolToken: smartContract {
        address {
          address
        }
      }
     
      trades: count
    }
  }
}


======================================================================

2.Get all senders to Liquidity pair address (LP) - these are sells.


Query:

{
  ethereum(network: bsc) {
    transfers(
     	options:{desc:"block.timestamp.time"}
      currency: {is:"DESIRED CURRENCY ADDRESS HERE (IF THE USER CURRENTLY LOOK AT THE BNB CHART, ADD BNB ADDRESS)"}
      date: {till: "2022-05-08T13:14:23.862Z"}
      height: {gt: 0}
      amount: {gt: 0}
      sender: {in: ["LIQUIDITY PAIR ADDRESS"]}
    ) {
      block{
        timestamp{
          time(format: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
        }
      }
      receiver {
        address
      }
      amount
      amountInBnb: amount
      max_date: maximum(of: date)
      transaction {
        hash
        
      }
    }
  }
}


======================================================================

3.Get all receivers from Liquidity pair address (LP) - these are buys.

Query:

{
  ethereum(network: bsc) {
    transfers(
     	options:{desc:"block.timestamp.time"}
      currency: {is:"DESIRED CURRENCY ADDRESS HERE (IF THE USER CURRENTLY LOOK AT THE BNB CHART, ADD BNB ADDRESS)"}
      date: {till: "2022-05-08T13:14:23.862Z"}
      height: {gt: 0}
      amount: {gt: 0}
      receiver: {in: ["LIQUIDITY PAIR ADDRESS"]}
    ) {
      block{
        timestamp{
          time(format: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
        }
      }
      sender {
        address
      }
      amount
      transaction {
        hash
      }
    }
  }
}
