Get coin circulating supply.

In order to get the current coin supply we need to check the total minted and burned tokens and calculate the difference between them respectively.
This query also works for liquidity pairs and is useful to calculate if there are burned liquidity tokens.
You can use the "date:" option to check mints and burns over period of time.
The "gt:" parameter in "amount:" means "Greater than"
In this case "amount" and "gt" can be omitted.

Please be aware that some smart contracts don't emit events and there can be unrelevant data presented. This happens rarely.
This query can be used to get data for multiple addresses, just use the array syntax:

currency: {in: ["COIN1","COIN2","COIN3"]



Query:


{
  ethereum(network: bsc) {
    transfers(date: {since: null, till: null}, amount: {gt: 0}) {
      burned: amount(
        calculate: sum
        receiver: {in: ["0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead"]}
      )
      minted: amount(
        calculate: sum
        sender: {in: ["0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"]}
      )
      currency(currency: {in: ["`+DESIRED COIN ADDRESS VARIABLE HERE+`"]}) {
        symbol
        name
        address
      }
    }
  }
}
