Ethereum and Polygon are supported, including multi-chain search.
Get NFT recommendations - Use our Recommendations AI API to get visually and contextually similar images to the input image passed with url or uploaded file using state of the art computer vision AI. You can provide recommendations to your users e.g. like Amazon, Netflix so that you can increase revenue or build new AI-based products and experiences for your users.
Find counterfeit NFTs and verify authenticity of an NFT - Using our Duplicate Detection AI API you can find counterfeits and verify the authenticity of an NFT. Our API analyzes the input image passed with url or uploaded file and returns duplicates (i.e. counterfeits) against it using state of the art computer vision AI.
