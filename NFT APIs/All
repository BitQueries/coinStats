DOCS: https://cryptoslam.gitbook.io/docs/developers/cryptoslam-public-api


Free APIs of cryptoslam provides data for top100 collections and top100 sales over period of time.

The gathered data is accross all networks.

Enterprise API plan include endpoins for blockchains/collections/fan-tokens/indexes/sales.

According to their website:
Blockchain endpoint return blockchain-level NFT sales, transaction and buyer count data.
Collections endpoint return NFT collection information such as sales, transactions, price and volume change, owner count etc.
Fan-tokens endpoint return fan token information such as price, volume and market cap.
Global-indexes endpoint return aggregated market data around NFTs, fan tokens and NFT utility tokens.
Sales endpoint return NFT sales data such as token information, price, transaction and marketplace, buyer and seller, etc.



I made request for the Enterprise API plan pricing and more detailed information (currently waiting for response).
