Get newest pairs for chains supported by Bitquery.

Be aware that there will be delays of few minutes.

Tips:
The information must be added in array then filtered, because token0 and token1 are different.
Get the most used coins addresses which coins are paired with for each chain, for example WBNB,WETH,WAVAX,WMATIC,USDT,BUSD,USDC.
Then compare the most used coins for liquidity with token1 and token0 to distinguish which is the coin address which you search for (not the liquidity one).




For "ethereum(network:)" you can use variable for the desired network.

ethereum(network:ethclassic)
ethereum(network:velas)
ethereum(network:klaytn)
ethereum(network:celo_baklava)

=========================================

The following returns the monitored factory address for the respected chain.

smartContract {
        address{address}
      }
      
=========================================


Query:

query {
  ethereum(network: NETWORK NAME VARIABLE HERE){
    smartContractEvents(
      options: {desc:"block.height", limit:100}
      smartContractEvent: {is: "PairCreated"}){
      
     block {
        height
        timestamp {
          time(format: "%H:%M:%S")
        }
      }
      
      transaction {
        hash
      }

      smartContract {
        address{address}
      }
      arguments {
        index
        argument
        value
      }
    }
